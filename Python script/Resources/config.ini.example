# Phoenix Security AutoConfig Configuration File
# Copy this file to config.ini and customize the values as needed

[asset_component_creation]
# Configuration for automatic component creation from assets
# These parameters control how the --action_create_components_from_assets feature works

# Asset name similarity threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
# Controls how similar asset names must be to group together
# 1.0 = exact match required
# 0.8 = 80% similarity required
# 0.6 = 60% similarity required (more lenient grouping)
asset_name_similarity_threshold = 1.0

# Minimum number of assets with similar names required to suggest component creation
# If you have 5 assets named "web-server-1", "web-server-2", etc., 
# and this is set to 5, it will suggest creating a "web-server" component
# Set to a lower number (e.g., 3) to be more aggressive about component suggestions
# Set to a higher number (e.g., 10) to be more conservative
asset_group_min_size_for_component_creation = 5

# Alternative: You can also put these parameters in the [phoenix] section
# for backward compatibility with existing configurations
[phoenix]
# Uncomment and customize these if you prefer to keep all Phoenix settings together
# asset_name_similarity_threshold = 0.8
# asset_group_min_size_for_component_creation = 3

# Note: If both sections contain the same parameter, [asset_component_creation] takes precedence
